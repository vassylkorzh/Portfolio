## [Project 1 - TensorFlow-Speech-Recognition-Challenge](https://github.com/vassylkorzh/TensorFlow-Speech-Recognition-Challenge)
* We might be on the verge of too many screens. It seems like everyday, new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction are voice interfaces. But, for independent makers and entrepreneurs, it’s hard to build a simple speech detector using free, open data and code. Many voice recognition datasets require preprocessing before a neural network model can be built on them. To help with this, TensorFlow recently released the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people.

In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands. By improving the recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface tools, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.
* **Used technologies:**

  Pandas, Librosa, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, Keras.
## [Project 2 - Crime Scale Prediction ](https://github.com/vassylkorzh/Crime-Scale-Prediction-)
* The aim of the study is to develop a model to predict the crime scale of a new region, knowing its demographic data.

**Steps :**

* Data analysing 
* Data cleaning 
* Working with skewness
* Model building and evaluating
* Choosing hyperparameters
* Stacking

## [Project 4 - ETL-Vachicle-Service](https://github.com/vassylkorzh/ETL-Project-Vachicle-Service)
* There are 5 errors in the data. Find them

The CustomerID field does not contain duplicate records.

Suggest explanations how each of the errors could have occurred 
and what you think is the best way to fix each one.

You know that the total projected revenue for 2016 equals: $419,896,187.87. 
You need the uploaded data to match this value (this means that every row is important).

### First step 

Using Visual Studio with ssdt-bi I automatically excluded  
![](/img/VisualStudio.PNG)

The condition to split the data into bad and good records was 

`if len(column6)>0 & len(2016E)==0 it all bad raws due to there error `

"CustomerID" | "CustomerSince"| "Vehicle" | "2014" | "2015" | "2016E" | "Column 6"|
-------------|----------------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|
  2738818    |  2014-01-01    |2009 Chevrolet Traverse|118|01|122.55|725.89
 
 1. 2738818;2014-01-01;2009 Chevrolet Traverse;118;01;122.55;725.89 - error due to 118;01; as for me here it should be 118.01

## [Project 5 - Customer_Segmentation](https://github.com/vassylkorzh/Customer_Segmentation)
### Using Machine Learning to segment customers in Python&Tableau
  
   Customer Segmentation is one of the most important applications of unsupervised learning. Using clustering techniques, companies can identify several segments of customers allowing them to target the potential user base.
